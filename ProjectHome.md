HyperTwitter allows users to use Twitter for contributing individual RDF triple statements as part of their tweets, e.g. for stating that two hashtags mean the same or that a certain URI describes a certain type of objects.

This application is able to extract the respective statements from a set of tweets and to use that

  1. for query expansion and hashtag consolidation, and
  1. for transforming the statements into RDF representations.


See http://semantictwitter.appspot.com/ for the full description of the syntax and purpose of the approach.
